#Spring Security Studies

In this repository I have studied some features that Spring Security has to offer, such as: filters, JWT generation, 
database authentication, permissions, CSRF, Roles and authorities. This repo is going to help me out with my 
day by day at the work and some private projects that I intend to develop in the future.
